You are an expert Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer, specializing in creating modern, scalable web applications using React/Next.js and Firebase

Objective: Generate a detailed project plan, component structure, and foundational code for a comprehensive "Multi Tools Calculator" website. The project should be designed for rapid development, assuming the use of a visual builder (we'll call it "Firebase Studio") for the front-end, which connects seamlessly to a Firebase backend for data, authentication, and hosting.
Project Name: MultiToolVerse0.1

1. Core Concept
Multi ToolVerse0.1 is a one-stop web application that provides users with a wide range of free online calculators and utility tools. The design should be clean, minimalist, and extremely fast. The primary goal is to offer a user-friendly experience with easily accessible tools, categorized for convenience.

2. Key Features to Implement
A. Frontend & UI/UX (The "Firebase Studio" Part):
Modern & Clean UI: A minimalist design with a focus on usability. Use a simple color palette (e.g., white, gray, and a single accent color).
Responsive Design: The layout must be fully responsive and work flawlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Categorized Navigation: A sidebar or top navigation bar that clearly lists the tool categories (e.g., Finance, Health, Math, Converters).
Powerful Search Bar: A prominent search bar on the homepage that allows users to instantly find a tool (e.g., typing "BMI" or "loan" should show relevant results).

Individual Tool Pages: Each calculator should have its own dedicated, SEO-friendly URL (e.g., Multitoolverse0.1.com/calculators/bmi-calculator).
Light/Dark Mode: A toggle to switch between light and dark themes.
Instant Calculations: All calculations should happen client-side in real-time as the user inputs data, without needing a page refresh.

B. Calculator & Tool Categories (with examples):
Financial Calculators:
Loan/EMI Calculator
Simple & Compound Interest Calculator
GST/VAT Calculator
Investment Return (ROI) Calculator
Health & Fitness Calculators:
Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator
Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator
Daily Calorie Intake Calculator
Math & Science Calculators:
Scientific Calculator
Percentage Calculator
Fraction Calculator
Random Number Generator
Unit Converters:
Length (Meters, Feet, Inches)
Weight (Kilograms, Pounds)
homeopathic medicine finder
Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)
Data (Bytes, KB, MB, GB)
Developer Tools:
URL Encoder/Decoder
Base64 Encoder/Decoder
Color Converter (HEX to RGB)
Unix Timestamp Converter

3. Technology Stack & Architecture ("Firebase Studio" Concept)

For this prompt, assume "Firebase Studio" is a hypothetical low-code/no-code platform that lets you:
Visually build React components.
Use a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind CSS by default.
Seamlessly connect UI elements to a Firebase backend.
Your generated plan should be based on this stack:
Frontend Framework: React (or Next.js for SEO benefits).
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
Backend as a Service (BaaS): Firebase
Hosting: Use Firebase Hosting for fast, global deployment.
Authentication (Optional): Use Firebase Authentication if we want to add features like saving favorite tools or calculation history for users. Start without it, but design for its potential inclusion.
Database: Use Firestore to store metadata about each tool (like its name, category, description, keywords for search). This allows us to dynamically generate the list of tools instead of hardcoding it.
Cloud Functions (Optional): For complex calculations or tools that require external API calls (e.g., a real-time currency converter), plan to use Firebase Cloud Functions.

4. Your Task: Generate the Following Output

Please provide a detailed, actionable plan:
1. Project Structure:
Create a logical folder structure for a React/Next.js project.
code
Code
/src
  /components
    /calculators
    /common (Navbar, Footer, SearchBar)
    /layout
  /pages (or /app for Next.js 13+)
  /styles
  /utils (for calculation logic)

2. Firestore Database Schema:
Design a simple Firestore collection schema. For example, a tools collection where each document represents a calculator.
code

Collection: 'tools'
Document ID: 'bmi-calculator'
{
  "name": "BMI Calculator",
  "category": "Health & Fitness",
  "description": "Calculate your Body Mass Index.",
  "urlPath": "/calculators/bmi-calculator",
  "keywords": ["bmi", "health", "weight", "fitness"]
}
3. Example Component Code (React + Tailwind CSS):
Write the full code for the BMI Calculator component.
It should include input fields for height (in cm) and weight (in kg).
It must display the calculated BMI score in real-time.
It should also show the BMI category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight) based on the result.
Make sure the code is well-commented and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.

4. Development Plan & Steps:
Provide a step-by-step plan from setting up the project to deployment.
Step 1: Setup Firebase project and React/Next.js app.
Step 2: Configure Tailwind CSS.
Step 3: Build the main layout (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer).
Step 4: Create the dynamic routing and fetch tool data from Firestore to populate the navigation.
Step 5: Develop the first tool (BMI Calculator) as a reusable component.
Step 6: Create a generic ToolPage template that can render any calculator component based on the URL.
Step 7: Deploy to Firebase Hosting.

5. UI/UX Design Suggestions:
Briefly describe the visual design for the homepage and a tool page. Mention where to place elements for the best user experience.
